This task went fairly smoothly, had some issues implementing this line:
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class" value="org.postgresql.Driver"/>

However i figured out i was missing the necessary postgresql.jar file.

After that I had some testing and fixing to do seeing how I had struggled with the 4th assignment,
but using this instead somehow made assignment 4 easier.

Building my own dockerized application was fairly easy tho, just had minor issues where I
missmatched my gradle version.
